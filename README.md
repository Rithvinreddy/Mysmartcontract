This project is a blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) developed to improve the traditional land registry system. Existing systems are often slow, complex, and vulnerable to fraud due to excessive paperwork and lack of transparency. To address these issues, this DApp uses Ethereum smart contracts to automate land transactions and store records securely on the blockchain. The goal is to provide a tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible platform for verifying and transferring land ownership.

The system is designed to benefit a wide range of users, including property owners, buyers, government agencies, legal professionals, and even marginalized communities that face challenges in proving land ownership. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform reduces reliance on intermediaries, speeds up processing times, and ensures trust and accuracy in property dealings.

Technologies used in this project include Solidity for smart contract development, Ethereum blockchain, Web3.js for frontend interaction, and tools like Truffle, Ganache, Remix IDE, and Visual Studio Code for testing and deployment. The smart contract code for this project can be found here.

This DApp was developed as part of an internship under the VOIS for Tech Program, a collaborative initiative by Connecting Dreams Foundation and the Vodafone Idea Foundation. The project allowed me to explore real-world blockchain applications and enhance my understanding of secure and decentralized systems.
